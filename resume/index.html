                  specifically, I love to code tools that make my life, or
                  others' lives, easier/more interesting/happier, especially when
                  the original task is not even possible for humans. I'm an
                  advocate for open source technologies and tools like GitHub
                  (that make open source cool).</p>
              <p>The langauges and tools I am most familiar with are:</p>

                    <h4>Java</h4>
                    <p>I've been coding in Java for 8 years, and consider
                      myself a Java enthusiast. I am very experienced in the many
                      sides of Java: i) core libraries, ii) web technologies, and
                      iii) as the server's glue.</p>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Objective-C</h4>
                    <p>I've been coding in Objective-C for 4 years. I have
                      built several apps using the various iOS frameworks (iOS 4,
                      5, 6, 7). I currently have 3 apps active in the iTunes store.
                      </p>

                      be found on my github account.

                    <p>
                      I'm comfortable with both, and can transition between the two
                      quickly (though I <em>really</em> prefer Linux.)</p>
                  <li>
                    <h4>Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, SPARQL, and
                      MongoDB</h4>
                    <p>I have extensive experience (around 10 years) with
                      relational databases.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Focused on ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tools and
                        development of generic APIs to reduce development time for
                        logistical applications while improving performance at the
                        data layer. I have also architected solutions around the
                        Drools 5 framework. One aspect of my research was looking at
                        Drools to provide autonomic capabilities through the use of
                        complex event processing (CEP), event stream processing
                        (ESP), and workflows. I also have experience with the

                        SQL, postgres and mysql as well as hsqldb for embedded
                        databases internal to datamigration tasks. I have extensive
                        experience in using constraints, views, triggers, stored
                        procedures, and batch jobs.
